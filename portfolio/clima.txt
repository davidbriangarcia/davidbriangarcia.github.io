  ClimaGlobal Weather Dashboard


  This project is a comprehensive, single-page weather application designed to provide users with detailed, real-time meteorological data for any location worldwide.

  Key Technical Features:


   * Multi-API Integration: The application aggregates data from several external services to provide a rich user experience:
       * Tomorrow.io: For real-time weather, hourly forecasts, and 5-day forecasts.
       * Weatherbit.io: For historical weather data, displayed in a monthly average chart.
       * OpenCage Geocoding: To power the city search functionality, converting user queries into geographic coordinates.
       * Wikipedia API: To fetch and display relevant tourist information and images for the selected city.


   * Client-Side Caching: To optimize performance and minimize redundant API requests, the application implements a caching layer using localStorage. Weather and historical data are cached
     for one hour, ensuring a fast and efficient experience for repeat searches.


   * Interactive Mapping: Utilizes the Leaflet.js library to display an interactive map that visually pinpoints the user's selected location, updating dynamically with each new search.


   * Dynamic & Responsive UI:
       * Dynamic Theming: Features a seamless dark/light mode toggle. The user's preference is saved in localStorage and automatically applied on future visits. The UI is built with CSS
         variables for easy theme management.
       * Data Visualization: Employs Chart.js to render interactive line and bar charts for hourly temperature forecasts and historical data, making complex data easy to understand.
       * Responsive Design: The interface is fully responsive, adapting from a multi-panel layout on desktops to a streamlined, touch-friendly view on mobile devices with a dedicated
         navigation bar.


   * Modern JavaScript & Geolocation:
       * Built with modern JavaScript (ES6+), including async/await for handling asynchronous API calls.
       * Leverages the browser's Geolocation API to automatically fetch weather data for the user's current location upon granting permission.
